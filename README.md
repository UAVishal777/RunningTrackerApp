# RunningTrackerApp

Creating a well-documented README file is essential for any software project, including your Android Running App. A good README helps other developers understand your project quickly and provides clear instructions on how to use it. Here's a template you can use to create a README for your app:

# Android Running App

![App Logo](link-to-your-app-logo.png) <!-- If applicable -->

## Overview

The Android Running App is a fitness application designed to help users track their running activities, including distance, time, calorie burn, and route mapping. It incorporates various Android technologies such as Android Map, Dagger Hilt, Room Database, LiveData, and ViewModel.

## Features

- Track running activities in real-time.
- Store running history using Room Database.
- Calculate calorie burns based on user input.
- View running statistics using LiveData and ViewModel.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Android Studio 4.0 or later
- Android SDK with a minimum API level of 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop)
- [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Dependency Injection Library
- [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started) - To use the Android Map feature
- Android device or emulator for testing

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Android Running App on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/running-app.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Add your Google Maps API Key to the `google_maps_api.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <resources>
       <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
   </resources>
   ```

4. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage

- Upon launching the app, users can sign in or create an account if required.

- To start a running activity, click the "Start Run" button and grant location permissions.

- During the run, users can view their current statistics, including distance, time, and calorie burn.

- When the run is complete, click the "Stop Run" button, and the data will be saved to the Room Database.

- Users can view their running history and statistics in the app.

## Architecture

The Android Running App follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. Here's an overview of the key components:

- **View**: Activities and Fragments responsible for displaying UI and receiving user input.

- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and provides it to the View. It also handles user interactions and updates the Model.

- **Model**: Contains the data and business logic, including the Room Database for storing running history.

- **Dagger Hilt**: Used for dependency injection to ensure clean and modular code.
